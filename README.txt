This repository is meant for functionality that isn't part of SIEGE itself --
either because it is too niche to warrant inclusion into SIEGE, or because the
feature is not yet complete or stable enough (but is still useful as it is).

Many of these will rely on the SIEGE library, and will keep a similar API to
SIEGE -- except that "sg*" is replaced with "sge*".

The license is the same as that of SIEGE -- 2-clause BSD license. If you want
to use this separately, outside of SIEGE, but don't want to also have to copy
the license text around all over the place, let me know and maybe (just
maybe) I'll change it to Unlicense or CC0 or something.
